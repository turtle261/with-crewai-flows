# CopilotKit <> CrewAI Flow Starter

This is a starter template for building AI agents using [CrewAI Flows](https://docs.crewai.com/en/concepts/flows) and [CopilotKit](https://copilotkit.ai). It provides a modern Next.js application with an integrated CrewAI Flow agent to be built on top of.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ 
- Python 3.8+
- Any of the following package managers:
  - [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) (recommended)
  - npm
  - [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#mac-stable)
  - [bun](https://bun.sh/)
- Google Gemini API Key (for the CrewAI Flow agent)

> **Note:** This repository ignores lock files (package-lock.json, yarn.lock, pnpm-lock.yaml, bun.lockb) to avoid conflicts between different package managers. Each developer should generate their own lock file using their preferred package manager. After that, make sure to delete it from the .gitignore.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies using your preferred package manager:
```bash
# Using pnpm (recommended)
pnpm install

# Using npm
npm install

# Using yarn
yarn install

# Using bun
bun install
```

> **Note:** Installing the package dependencies will also install the agent's python dependencies via the `install:agent` script.


2. Set up your Gemini API key:
```bash
cd backend
echo "GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-api-key-here" > .env
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
# Using pnpm (recommended)
pnpm dev

# Using npm
npm run dev

# Using yarn
yarn dev

# Using bun
bun run dev
```

This will start both the UI and agent servers concurrently. The backend uses
Gemini via LiteLLM and exposes a FastMCP server on port 8000.

## Available Scripts
The following scripts can also be run using your preferred package manager:
- `dev` - Starts both UI and agent servers in development mode
- `dev:debug` - Starts development servers with debug logging enabled
- `dev:ui` - Starts only the Next.js UI server
- `dev:agent` - Starts only the CrewAI Flow agent server
- `build` - Builds the Next.js application for production
- `start` - Starts the production server
- `lint` - Runs ESLint for code linting
- `install:agent` - Installs Python dependencies for the agent

## Documentation

The main UI component is in `src/app/page.tsx`. You can:
- Modify the theme colors and styling
- Add new frontend actions
- Utilize shared-state
- Customize your user-interface for interactin with CrewAI Flow

## Troubleshooting

### Agent Connection Issues
If you see "I'm having trouble connecting to my tools", make sure:
1. The CrewAI Flow agent is running on port 8000
2. Your Gemini API key is set correctly
3. Both servers started successfully
